I made a short video by mixing some clips I took while traveling around the world from January 21 to December 29, 2015.

124 cities in 36 countries for 330 days.

It was a long and short trip and a trip that was neither special nor ordinary.

It was a pleasant, exciting and ecstatic journey, but once again, not every moment was delightful. Rather, there were more experiences that were a series of crises and tribulations and were always at a moment of choices, and the result derived from those choices had returned to my responsibility.

In South America, my sack was stolen along with my passport, photos, and cash. In Africa, I suffered from cholera and from an unknown disease. I also encountered an angry wild elephant, rushing toward us while we were walking around the grasslands of Okavango Delta. In Europe, I had undergone a slump due to doubts about the trip itself.

However, I had overcome the various adversities and finished the journey safely.

Now that I think about it, the tough and bitter moments were also part of the trip and now they remain as a valuable memory. These experiences gave me the opportunity to become a more mature and stronger person.

In the future, I might lose something I care the most in the blink of an eye; be so exhausted and sick; dare to face a calvary that seems too great to handle; or lose my will and suffer from a deep slump, leaving myself into depression.

However, as the hardships of my journey did not prevent me from continuing my journey, I should try to make sure that the agonies I meet in the future will not hinder my way, and that they will make me a better "me" than yesterday.

Just as this trip remains a pleasant and charming experience, I will try to remember every moment of my life as a cheering and delightful memory.

Although there were some dissatisfying moments, it was a happy and regretless year overall.
